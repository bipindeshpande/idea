# Pricing Validation Method

## Pre-Pricing Research

### Competitive Analysis
- What do competitors charge?
- What's the price range in the market?
- What's the perceived value?

### Customer Research
- What are customers currently paying?
- What would they pay for your solution?
- What's their budget range?

## Pricing Tests

### Method 1: Direct Ask
Ask customers: "What would you pay for this?"
- Pros: Direct feedback
- Cons: May be inaccurate

### Method 2: Price Anchoring
Show multiple price points:
- Basic: $X/month
- Pro: $Y/month
- Enterprise: $Z/month
- See which gets most interest

### Method 3: Pre-Order Test
Offer early access at discount:
- "Pre-order for $X (50% off)"
- Measure conversion rate
- Test different price points

### Method 4: Van Westendorp
Ask four questions:
1. At what price is this too expensive?
2. At what price is this too cheap?
3. At what price is this expensive but worth it?
4. At what price is this a bargain?
