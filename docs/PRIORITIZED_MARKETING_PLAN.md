# 🎯 Prioritized Marketing Plan - What to Actually Do

**TL;DR: Start with 3-4 high-impact activities. Don't try to do everything at once.**

---

## ✅ **DO THESE FIRST (High ROI, Low Time)**

### **Tier 1: Must Do (2-3 hours total)**

#### **1. Product Hunt Launch** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Time:** 30 minutes prep + launch day engagement
**Impact:** HIGH - Can get 50-200 upvotes, 10-30 signups
**Why:** Biggest single-day traffic boost you'll get
**ROI:** 10/10

**Do this:** Yes, absolutely. This is your #1 priority.

---

#### **2. Email Your Network** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Time:** 15 minutes
**Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH - 5-15 signups from people you know
**Why:** Easiest, most personal, highest conversion rate
**ROI:** 10/10

**Do this:** Yes, do this today. Takes 15 minutes, sends to 20-50 people.

---

#### **3. One Reddit Post** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Time:** 20 minutes
**Impact:** MEDIUM - 5-15 signups if done right
**Why:** Free, targeted audience, but requires careful execution
**ROI:** 8/10

**Do this:** Yes, but pick ONE subreddit (r/startups is best). Don't spam multiple.

---

### **Tier 2: Should Do (1-2 hours)**

#### **4. Social Media Setup (Pick ONE)** ⭐⭐⭐
**Time:** 30 minutes
**Impact:** MEDIUM - 2-5 signups initially, builds over time
**Why:** Long-term value, but slow start
**ROI:** 6/10

**Do this:** 
- **LinkedIn** if you have professional network
- **Twitter** if you're comfortable with it
- **Don't do both** - pick one and be consistent

---

#### **5. Indie Hackers Post** ⭐⭐⭐
**Time:** 15 minutes
**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM - 3-8 signups
**Why:** Good community, but smaller reach
**ROI:** 6/10

**Do this:** Yes, but only if you have 15 minutes. Not critical.

---

## ⚠️ **DO LATER (After You Have Some Traction)**

### **Tier 3: Nice to Have (Do After Tier 1-2 Works)**

#### **6. Blog Posts** ⭐⭐⭐
**Time:** 2-4 hours per post
**Impact:** LOW initially, HIGH long-term (SEO)
**Why:** Takes time to see results, but valuable long-term
**ROI:** 5/10 short-term, 9/10 long-term

**Do this:** 
- ✅ Yes, but start with 1 post
- ✅ Only if you have 2-3 hours
- ✅ Focus on SEO keywords
- ❌ Don't write 3 posts at once

---

#### **7. Multiple Reddit Posts** ⭐⭐
**Time:** 1-2 hours
**Impact:** MEDIUM - but diminishing returns
**Why:** Risk of looking spammy
**ROI:** 4/10

**Do this:** 
- ❌ Don't post to 3-5 subreddits on same day
- ✅ Post to 1 subreddit, wait a week, post to another
- ✅ Focus on being helpful, not promotional

---

#### **8. Directory Submissions** ⭐⭐
**Time:** 1-2 hours
**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM - 1-5 signups per directory
**Why:** Takes time, low conversion, but free backlinks
**ROI:** 4/10

**Do this:** 
- ✅ Yes, but batch them (do 5 at once, 30 min)
- ✅ Don't spend hours on this
- ✅ Focus on top 5 directories only

---

## ❌ **DON'T DO (At Least Not Yet)**

### **Tier 4: Skip for Now**

#### **9. Paid Ads** ❌
**Why:** 
- You don't know your conversion rate yet
- You don't know your customer acquisition cost
- You might waste money
- Wait until you have 20-50 paying customers first

**Do this:** ❌ No, wait 1-2 months

---

#### **10. Multiple Social Media Accounts** ❌
**Why:**
- Hard to maintain multiple accounts
- Better to do one well than three poorly
- Focus your energy

**Do this:** ❌ No, pick ONE platform

---

#### **11. Email Newsletter** ❌
**Why:**
- You need subscribers first
- Takes time to build
- Focus on getting users, not building email list yet

**Do this:** ❌ No, wait until you have 100+ users

---

## 🚨 **Common Mistakes**

1. **Trying to do everything** → Burnout, nothing works well
2. **Spamming communities** → Get banned, bad reputation

---

## ✅ **My Honest Recommendation**

### **Start Here (This Week):**
1. ✅ **Product Hunt** - Do this, it's your biggest opportunity
2. ✅ **Email your network** - 15 minutes, easy wins

**Expected:** 20-50 signups

---

### **Next Week:**
- If Product Hunt worked → Engage more, share results
- If Reddit worked → Post to another subreddit (wait a week)
- If social media worked → Keep posting consistently
- Write 1 blog post (if you have time)

**Time:** 2-3 hours
**Expected:** 10-20 more signups

---

### **Month 2+:**
- Double down on what worked
- Stop what didn't work
- Add 1-2 new channels
- Consider paid ads (if you have data and budget)

---

## 🎯 **Bottom Line**

**Don't try to do everything.** 

**Start with:**
1. Product Hunt (30 min)
2. Email network (15 min)
3. One Reddit post (20 min)
4. One social platform (30 min)

**Total: 2 hours → 20-50 signups**

Then, **based on results**, decide what to do next.

**Focus > Volume**

---

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- How much time do I have per week? (Be honest)
- What am I good at? (Writing, video, community?)
- What's working? (Track everything)
- What's not working? (Stop doing it)

**Start small, track results, scale what works.** 🚀
