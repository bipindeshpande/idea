2. Find DNS settings

4. I'll help you with exact settings when ready

**Don't worry about this yet - we'll do it together!**

### Step 3: Set Up Email (When Ready)

**What you need:**
- Email inbox to receive emails

- When you're ready to receive emails

**How to do it:**
1. Sign up for Proton Mail (free)
2. Add your domain: `ideabunch.com`

4. Done!

**I'll guide you through this when ready!**
