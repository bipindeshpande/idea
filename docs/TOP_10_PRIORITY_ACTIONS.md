## Based on Startup User Psyche Analysis

---

## 🎯 **THE 10 YOU SHOULD IMPLEMENT**

### **1. Fix Pricing Strategy** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Why:** Current pricing is confusing and creates friction

**Action:**
- **Remove Weekly Plan** ($5/week = $20/month, more expensive than Pro!)
- **Increase Starter Plan:** Change from 10 to 20 validations/month (or $7 → $9/month)
- **Add Annual Option:** $120/year (save $60) - 2 months free
- **Keep Free & Pro as-is** (they're good)

**Impact:** 🟢 HIGH - Removes confusion, increases Starter plan value perception
**Effort:** 🟢 LOW - Just update pricing page and backend logic
**Timeline:** 1-2 days

### **2. ✅ Add "See Sample Report" Before Signup** - ALREADY DONE
**Status:** ✅ You mentioned you already have this - Great!

**Action (if not prominent enough):**
- Make sure sample report is easily accessible on landing page
- Add prominent button/link: "See Sample Report" or "View Example"
- Ensure it's visible above the fold
- Consider adding multiple industry examples

**Impact:** 🟢 VERY HIGH - Builds trust, reduces skepticism, increases signups
**Effort:** 🟢 LOW - Just ensure visibility and accessibility

### **3. Add Social Proof (Alternatives to Testimonials)** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Why:** No credibility indicators - users are taking a leap of faith
**Reality:** You're just starting, so no testimonials yet - Use alternatives!

  - "Join our early adopters - Get lifetime discount"

  - Your own story/background
  - Why you built this tool
  - Personal credibility

  - "Average validation score: 6.8/10"
  - "Top 20% of ideas score 7.5+"
