    YOU MUST START YOUR RESPONSE WITH EXACTLY THIS LINE (copy it exactly):
    ## 1. Core Motivation

    DO NOT write "Profile Summary Document" or any title before this.
    DO NOT use bold headings like **Core Motivations**.
    DO NOT use numbered lists like 1. Core Motivations.
    ONLY use markdown headings: ## 1. Core Motivation

    CRITICAL: Write in second-person ("You") ONLY. Never use "the user" or "their." Write like you're talking directly to the person.

    CRITICAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENT: Do NOT simply repeat what the user told you. You MUST provide insights, reasoning, and analysis. Explain:
    - WHY their inputs matter and what they reveal
    - WHAT these inputs mean strategically
    - HOW different inputs connect and create opportunities or constraints
    - WHAT the user might not realize about their own profile
    - WHAT patterns or implications emerge from their choices

    Your job is to ANALYZE and provide VALUE, not echo back their inputs. If you just restate what they said, you've failed.

    User inputs:
    - Goal Type: {goal_type}
    - Time Commitment: {time_commitment}
    - Budget Range: {budget_range}
    - Interest Area: {interest_area}
    - Sub-Interest Focus: {sub_interest_area}
    - Preferred Work Style: {work_style}
    - Primary Skill Strength: {skill_strength}
    - Experience Summary: {experience_summary}
    - Founder Psychology: {founder_psychology}

    WRITING RULES (non-negotiable):
    - Use "You" not "the user" or "they"
    - Use short, punchy sentences
    - Avoid: "Given the fact that", "It is important to note", "Additionally", "Furthermore"
    - Be specific: "Botpress, Rasa, Dialogflow" not "various chatbot frameworks"
    - Focus on execution: "Week 1: Build a basic intent bot" not "The first phase should involve..."
    - Keep paragraphs under 3 sentences
    - Use bullet points liberally

    MANDATORY OUTPUT FORMAT - COPY THIS EXACT STRUCTURE:
    
    ## 1. Core Motivation
    
    [ANALYZE their goal type and experience summary. Don't just say "You want to {goal_type}". Instead, explain:
    - What this goal type reveals about their priorities and mindset
    - What underlying motivations drive this choice
    - What patterns in their experience summary connect to this goal
    - What they might be seeking beyond the surface-level goal
    Start with "You're exploring..." or "You want to..." but then add WHY and WHAT THIS MEANS. 3-4 sentences with real insight.]

    ## 2. Operating Constraints
    
    [ANALYZE the constraints, don't just list them. Explain the implications and trade-offs:
    - Time ({time_commitment}): What this ACTUALLY means for project scope, what types of projects are realistic vs. unrealistic, what shortcuts or approaches this forces, what opportunities this creates (e.g., "10 hours/week means you can't build a complex SaaS, but you CAN validate ideas quickly through no-code tools")
    - Work Style ({work_style}): How this shapes execution, what types of projects match this style, what challenges this creates, what advantages this provides
    - Budget ({budget_range}): What tools/platforms this enables or rules out, what business models are feasible, what risks this creates, what creative solutions this demands
    Each point should be 2-3 sentences with real analysis, not just "Your budget is {budget_range}."]

    ## 3. Opportunity Within [Interest Area]
    
    [ANALYZE why this interest area matters NOW and what opportunities exist. Don't just list the interest area. Explain:
    - Why this area is timely (market trends, technology shifts, demand signals)
    - What specific opportunities exist within this area that match their constraints
    - What gaps or problems exist that their skills could address
    - What the user might not know about opportunities in this space
    2-3 bullet points with concrete examples, specific tool names, frameworks, or market signals. Each bullet should provide insight, not just state facts.]

    ## 4. Strengths You Can Leverage
    
    [ANALYZE their skill strength and experience. Don't just repeat what they said. Explain:
    - What this strength ACTUALLY means in practice
    - How this strength gives them an advantage others don't have
    - What types of problems this strength is uniquely suited to solve
    - What the user might not realize about how valuable this strength is
    2-4 bullet points. Each point: one strength + WHY it matters + HOW it helps execution + WHAT it enables. Example: "Strong automation mindset → You naturally think in systems and flows, which means you can design logical conversation triggers that others struggle with. This gives you an edge in building chatbots that actually work, not just look good."]

    ## 5. Skill Gaps to Fill
    
    [ANALYZE what's missing. Don't just list skills. Explain:
    - WHY these gaps matter for their goals
    - WHAT happens if they don't fill these gaps
    - HOW these gaps connect to their interest area and constraints
    - WHAT the fastest path to filling these gaps is
    2-4 bullet points. Be concrete: "NLP basics: intents, entities, context, conversation memory" NOT "understanding of technical concepts." Each point should explain WHY this gap matters and WHAT it blocks.]

    ## 6. Recommendations
    
    [Actionable steps in bullet format. Include specific platform/tool choices, concrete project framing, weekly milestones (Week 1: X, Week 2: Y, Week 3: Z, Week 4: W), learning approach, community resources, success metrics as questions.]

    ## 7. Founder Psychology Summary (INTERNAL - for downstream agents)
    
    [Interpret the founder_psychology data and provide structured insights. This section is for downstream agents to use, not shown directly to user. Include:
    - psyche_summary: Brief interpretation of psychological signals (motivation_primary, motivation_secondary, biggest_fear, decision_style, energy_pattern, constraints, success_definition)
    - execution_tendencies: How they likely approach execution based on decision_style and energy_pattern
    - risk_reactivity: How they respond to risks based on biggest_fear and decision_style
    - confidence_signals: Indicators of confidence level from their inputs
    - ideal_work_patterns: Optimal work patterns based on energy_pattern and constraints
    Keep this concise - 2-3 bullet points per field.]

    ## 8. Clarifications Needed (for downstream agents)
    
    [3-5 questions. Format as questions, not statements. Example: "Which chatbot niche interests you most?" NOT "It would be helpful to know which chatbot niche..."]

    STRICT REQUIREMENTS:
    - Total word count: 600-800 words maximum

    A concise strategic summary with numbered sections in this EXACT format. Use second-person ("You") throughout.

    ## 1. Core Motivation
    
    One paragraph (2-3 sentences max) explaining their real drive in plain language. Start with "You're exploring..." or "You want to..." NOT "The user's goal is..." or "Given the interest in..."

    ## 2. Operating Constraints
    
    Break down time, work style, and budget with specific implications. Format as:
    - Time ({time_commitment}): One sentence on what this means for project scope
    - Work Style ({work_style}): One sentence on how this shapes execution
    - Budget ({budget_range}): One sentence on what tools/platforms this enables or rules out

    ## 3. Opportunity Within [Interest Area]

idea_research_task:
  description: >
    Based on the user's profile analysis, research and generate at least five (ideally 5-8) innovative startup ideas that:
    - Align with the user's goal type: {goal_type}
    - Match their stated time commitment: {time_commitment}
    - Respect the available budget range: {budget_range}
    - Fit the primary interest area: {interest_area} and sub-focus: {sub_interest_area}
    - Leverage their primary skill strength: {skill_strength}
    - Support the preferred work style: {work_style}
    - Build on context from the experience summary: {experience_summary}
    - Consider founder psychology factors: {founder_psychology} (optional context for idea generation)

    IMPORTANT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENT:
    - Begin your response with the exact heading `### Idea Research Report`
    - Follow with a short executive summary paragraph (3-4 sentences)
    - Provide a numbered list of **at least five** ideas in the format `1. **Idea Name**` and include detailed subsections for each idea (see expected_output)
    - Close with a `### Validation Backlog` section containing bullet-point experiments
    - If you cannot meet this structure, you must explicitly state why and request another try. Never provide a one-line summary.

    IMPORTANT: Tool results have been pre-computed for your top ideas. Use the provided tool results context instead of calling tools directly. This saves significant time.
    
    The following tool results are available in your context:
    - Market trends research (pre-computed)
    - Competitor analysis (pre-computed)
    - Market size estimates (pre-computed)
    - Idea validation scores (pre-computed)
    
    Reference these pre-computed results in your analysis. Only call tools if you need additional information not in the context.

    Be concise. Produce the full report but keep each idea section focused. Every idea must be documented with sufficient depth to guide execution.

    For each idea, provide:
    - Business concept description and why it suits the intake profile
    - Target market and customer segments consistent with their interests and skills
    - Revenue model possibilities that respect budget boundaries
    - Required resources, team structure, and how the user's strengths/work style map to them
    - Time to market estimate based on stated time commitment
    - Competitive landscape overview (use analyze_competitors tool when helpful)
    - Market size estimation (use estimate_market_size tool when helpful)
    - Market trends analysis (use research_market_trends tool when helpful)
    - Validation score and feasibility assessment (use validate_startup_idea tool for key ideas)
    - Key challenges, required partnerships, and execution considerations
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive research document with the following structure:
    - Heading `### Idea Research Report`
    - Executive Summary paragraph (minimum 150 words)
    - Numbered ideas section (`1.` through at least `5.`) where each idea contains:
      * **Idea Fit Summary** covering concept and alignment with profile
      * **Market Opportunity** describing segments, sizing, and trends (reference tool outputs)
      * **Revenue Model & Financials** detailing pricing, monetization, cost assumptions
      * **Resource & Skill Mapping** connecting requirements to the user's strengths, work style, and capacity
      * **Timeline & Effort** with realistic milestones respecting time commitment and budget
      * **Risks & Mitigations** leveraging tool insights and noting alignment with their goal type and work style
      * **Immediate Experiments** listing 2-3 validation steps with success metrics
    - `### Validation Backlog` section aggregating experiments across ideas
    The output should be 800-1000 words (concise but complete). Focus on quality over length—avoid summaries or generic statements.

recommendation_task:
  description: >
    Based on the profile analysis and researched startup ideas, create personalized recommendations:
    - Rank the top 3 startup ideas that best match the user
    - Provide detailed reasoning grounded in goal type {goal_type}, time commitment {time_commitment}, budget {budget_range}, interest area {interest_area}, sub-focus {sub_interest_area}, work style {work_style}, skill strength {skill_strength}, experience summary {experience_summary}, and founder_psychology {founder_psychology}
    - Include actionable next steps for each top idea, highlighting how to leverage strengths and cover gaps
    - Outline execution timeline and milestones compatible with their availability and budget
    - Address potential challenges, capital requirements, and mitigation tactics
    - Provide tips for validation, traction tests, and resource allocation
    - Ensure that every section (execution, risks, experiments, validation questions, roadmap) contains idea-specific content and does not reuse wording from other ideas unless absolutely necessary; rewrite any repeated phrasing

    MANDATORY FORMAT (non-negotiable):
    - Start with the heading `### Comprehensive Recommendation Report`
    - Add a "Profile Fit Summary" subsection with bullet points translating the profile into insights
    - Present a table or bullet comparison showing how each top idea aligns with goals, budget, and risk
    - Provide a numbered list `1.` to `3.` titled **Idea Name** with deep dives (see expected_output)
      CRITICAL: Each idea MUST start with exactly: `1. **Idea Name**` (with number, period, space, bold, then idea name)
      Example: `1. **AI-Powered Customer Support Bot**` NOT `1. AI-Powered Customer Support Bot` (missing bold)
      Example: `**Idea Name**` NOT `1. **Idea Name**` (missing number)
    - Include dedicated sections for `### Financial Outlook`, `### Risk Radar`, `### Customer Persona`, `### Validation Questions`, and `### 30/60/90 Day Roadmap`
    - CRITICAL: The `### Risk Radar` and `### 30/60/90 Day Roadmap` sections MUST be highly specific to the recommended ideas and user profile. Generic content will be rejected. Each risk must explain HOW it impacts the specific idea given the user's constraints. Each roadmap milestone must be a concrete, actionable step with specific tools/platforms/actions, not vague tasks.
    - Close with `### Decision Checklist` summarizing go/no-go signals
    - ALWAYS produce at least 3 ideas, even if inputs are minimal. Use the inputs you have and make reasonable assumptions.
    - If inputs are minimal, still create detailed recommendations by making educated inferences from what's provided.
    - Before finalizing, check that each idea contains at least one execution milestone, risk, and validation prompt that references the idea's unique focus or audience; if not, rework that idea's section until all elements are distinct.

    LAYER 1 (Shared Facts - Pre-computed):
    Domain research data for {interest_area} has been pre-computed and is available in domain_research JSON files.
    This includes:
    - Market trends (market_trends)
    - Competitor overview (competitor_overview)
    - Market size estimates (market_size)
    - Opportunity map (opportunity_map)
    - Cost templates (cost_templates)
    
    These are objective, non-personalized facts that apply to the interest area. Use these as foundation data.
    
    LAYER 2 (Idea Themes):
    Tool results have been pre-computed for your top recommended idea. Use the provided tool results context instead of calling tools directly. This saves significant time.
    
    The following tool results are available in your context:
    - Risk assessment (pre-computed)
    - Startup cost estimates (pre-computed)
    - Revenue projections (pre-computed)
    - Financial viability analysis (pre-computed)
    - Customer persona (pre-computed)
    
    Reference these pre-computed results in your analysis. Only call tools if you need additional information not in the context.
    
    You may still use generate_validation_questions tool for all 3 ideas (this is fast).
    
    LAYER 3 (Personalization - YOUR JOB):
    Your task is to synthesize:
    - Domain research data (Layer 1 - shared facts)
    - Tool outputs (Layer 2 - structured data)
    - Profile analysis output (user-specific insights including Founder Psychology Summary section)
    - Idea research output (idea themes)
    - User profile inputs: goal_type, time_commitment, budget_range, interest_area, sub_interest_area, work_style, skill_strength, experience_summary
    - Founder psychology: {founder_psychology} (raw psychology data)
    - Profile analysis interpreted psyche signals (from profile_analysis_task section 7)
    
    Use founder_psychology and interpreted psyche signals to:
    - Rank ideas based on founder fit (how well each idea matches their psychological profile)
    - Personalize tone and narrative (match their decision_style, energy_pattern, motivation_primary)
    - Highlight risks based on fears (if biggest_fear = fear of failure, emphasize safe validation and quick wins)
    - Emphasize strengths and motivations (align recommendations with motivation_primary and motivation_secondary)
    - Adjust execution pacing using energy_pattern (if short bursts, break tasks into smaller blocks)
    - Tailor roadmap steps using decision_style (if fast: short, crisp, action-heavy; if slow: include checkpoints, reflection tasks)
    - Respect constraints (time, money, lifestyle) from constraints field
    - Explain why each idea uniquely fits this founder (connect idea features to psychological profile)
    
    BEHAVIORAL RULES:
    - If biggest_fear = fear of failure: emphasize safe validation, quick wins, and confidence building
    - If decision_style = fast: roadmap tasks should be short, crisp, and action-heavy
    - If decision_style = slow: roadmap should include checkpoints, reflection tasks, structured analysis
    - If energy_pattern = short bursts: break roadmap tasks into smaller, high impact blocks
    - If constraints include time/money: prioritize lean, low-commitment tasks early
    
    Generate a 100% personalized, unique recommendation that:
    - Combines shared domain facts with user-specific context
    - Ranks ideas based on user's goals, constraints, skills, and psychological profile
    - Provides personalized tone, examples, and next steps that match their psychology
    - Creates unique output for each user (no two users should see identical recommendations)
    
    This personalization step MUST use OpenAI every time to ensure uniqueness and relevance.

    Always return the full detailed recommendation in markdown. Be concise but complete. The output should contain detailed sections so the frontend can display structured insights.

      * Milestones must respect the user's time commitment ({time_commitment}) - if they have <5 hrs/week, don't suggest 40-hour tasks
      * Milestones must respect the user's budget ({budget_range}) - if budget is "Free/Sweat-equity", suggest free tools and platforms
      * Milestones must leverage the user's skill strength ({skill_strength}) and work style ({work_style})
      * Format: **Days 0-30**: [Specific action 1], [Specific action 2], [Specific action 3]. Success metric: [Measurable outcome]. **Days 30-60**: [Next phase actions]. **Days 60-90**: [Final phase actions]
      * DO NOT use generic phrases like "validate core assumptions" or "conduct market research" - be specific about WHAT to validate and HOW
    - `### Decision Checklist` highlighting signals to move forward or pivot
