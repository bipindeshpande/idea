# Startup Idea Crew 🚀

Welcome to the Startup Idea Crew project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). This project provides AI-powered startup idea recommendations tailored to your goals, time commitment, and interests.

## 🎯 What This Project Does

This CrewAI project uses a multi-agent system to:

1. **Analyze Your Profile** - Understand your goals, skills, time availability, and interests
2. **Research Startup Ideas** - Generate innovative startup ideas aligned with your profile
3. **Provide Recommendations** - Deliver personalized top 3 recommendations with actionable next steps

The team consists of specialized AI agents:
- **Profile Analyst**: Analyzes your professional profile and constraints
- **Idea Researcher**: Researches and generates relevant startup ideas
- **Recommendation Advisor**: Creates personalized recommendations with roadmaps

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python >=3.10,<3.14
- [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager (recommended) or pip
- OpenAI API key

## 🚀 Installation

### Step 1: Install UV (if not already installed)

```bash
pip install uv
```

### Step 2: Install CrewAI

```bash
uv tool install crewai
```

Or if you want the latest version:
```bash
uv tool upgrade crewai
```

### Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
crewai install
```

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   ```

## 🏃 Running the Project

### Option 1: Interactive Mode (Recommended)

Run the crew with interactive prompts:

```bash
crewai run
```

This will prompt you for:
- Your goals
- Time commitment
- Your interests

### Option 2: Direct Python Execution

```bash
python -m startup_idea_crew.main
```

### Option 3: REST API (Flask)

Run the Flask API to trigger the crew programmatically:

```bash
pip install -e .
python api.py
```

Then send a request (with `curl`, Postman, or your React frontend):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "goals": "Build a side business",
        "time_commitment": "10-15 hours per week",
        "interests": "AI, SaaS, automation"
      }'
```

The API responds with JSON containing the generated reports (profile analysis, startup ideas research, and personalized recommendations).

- Monitor your API usage at [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
- The analysis may take a few minutes depending on API response times

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Windows Users

If you get a "unicode" error when running `crewai create crew`, run this first:
```powershell
$env:PYTHONUTF8 = "1"
```

### API Key Issues

Make sure your `.env` file is in the project root and contains a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## 🖥️ React Frontend

A React frontend lives under `frontend/` and communicates with the Flask API.

### Setup & Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

With both the Flask API (`python api.py`) and the React dev server running, open the UI at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). The app proxies API requests to `http://localhost:8000/run`.
